# Android Maze Game

## A fully functional first-person maze game written in Java built to run as an Android app.

This project was built in the Software Development class at William and Mary. It started with the a Model-View-Controller architecture and some basic files to display as maze in a first-person view. I incrementally added algorithms for maze generation, maze solving, and player movement, among other things. Through this project, I also learned how to do multithreading and refactor code to easily change layout managers so an application in Java can be ported to Android.
